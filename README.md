# Sending Email Message by React
## Using [EmailJs](https://www.emailjs.com/) is one of the most important decision of project


In this project, we aim to send a message to the user's email using the emailJs tool.
At the beginning of the project, we design our form in the Request section. 
### The entire design of this form is handled by Bootstrap.
By using rows and segmenting sections of the page with columns, we create a fully responsive page.
After completing the JSX part of the project, we proceed to send the messages generated through the form.
